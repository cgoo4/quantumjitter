Before the post-Brexit trade negotiations concluded, what did quantitative textual analysis and word embeddings tell us about the shifting trade-talk sentiment?

Reading news articles on the will-they-won't-they post-Brexit trade negotiations with the EU sees days of optimism jarred by days of gloom. Do negative news articles, when one wants a positive outcome, leave a deeper impression?

Is it possible to get a more objective view from [quantitative analysis of textual data](https://quanteda.io)? To do this, I'm going to look at hundreds of articles published in the Guardian newspaper over the course of the year to see how trade-talk sentiment changed week-to-week.

The Withdrawal Agreement between the UK and the European Union was [signed on the 24th of January 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit_withdrawal_agreement). Brexit-related newspaper articles will be imported from that date.

::: callout-note
Since publishing this article in September 2020, [an agreement was reached on December 24th 2020](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-55476625).

The Guardian newspaper asks for requests to span no more than 1 month at a time. Creating a set of monthly date ranges will enable the requests to be chunked.

```{r}
#| label: dates

dates_df <- tibble(start_date = date_build(2020, 1:11, 25)) |> 
  mutate(end_date = add_months(start_date, 1) |> add_days(-1))

dates_df
```

Access to the Guardian's API via [guardianapi](https://github.com/cran/guardianapi)[@guardianapi] requires a key which may be requested [here](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/access/) and stored in the .Renviron file.

```{r}
#| label: read
#| results: hide
#| cache: true

tic()

read_slowly <- slowly(gu_content)

article_df <-
  pmap(dates_df, \(start_date, end_date) {
    read_slowly(
      "brexit",
      from_date = start_date,
      to_date = end_date
    )
  }) |> 
  list_rbind()

toc()
```

The data need a little cleaning, for example, to remove multi-topic articles, html tags and non-breaking spaces.

```{r}
#| label: clean

trade_df <-
  article_df |>
  filter(!str_detect(id, "/live/"), 
         section_id %in% c("world", "politics", "business")) |>
  mutate(
    body = str_remove_all(body, "<.*?>") |> str_to_lower(),
    body = str_remove_all(body, "[^a-z0-9 .-]"),
    body = str_remove_all(body, "nbsp")
  )
```

A corpus then gives me a collection of texts whereby each document is a newspaper article.

```{r}
#| label: corpus

trade_corp <- trade_df |> 
  corpus(docid_field = "short_url", 
         text_field = "body", unique_docnames = FALSE)
```

Although only articles mentioning Brexit have been imported, some of these will not be related to trade negotiations with the EU. For example, there are on-going negotiations with many countries around the world. So, word embeddings[@text2vec] will help to narrow the focus to the specific context of the UK-EU trade deal.

The chief negotiator for the EU is Michel Barnier, so I'll quantitatively identify words in close proximity to "Barnier" in the context of these Brexit news articles.

```{r}
#| label: embeddings

window <- 5

trade_fcm <-
  trade_corp |>
  fcm(context = "window", window = window, 
      count = "weighted", weights = window:1)

glove <- GlobalVectors$new(rank = 60, x_max = 10)

set.seed(42)

wv_main <- glove$fit_transform(trade_fcm, n_iter = 10)
wv_context <- glove$components
word_vectors <- wv_main + t(wv_context)

search_coord <- 
  word_vectors["barnier", , drop = FALSE]

word_vectors |> 
  sim2(search_coord, method = "cosine") |> 
  as_tibble(rownames = NA) |> 
  rownames_to_column("term") |> 
  rename(similarity = 2) |> 
  slice_max(similarity, n = 10)
```

Word embedding is a learned modelling technique placing words into a multi-dimensional vector space such that contextually-similar words may be found close by. Not surprisingly, one of the closest words contextually is "Michel". And as he is the chief negotiator for the EU, we find "negotiator" and "brussels" also in the top most contextually-similar words.

The word embeddings algorithm, through word co-occurrence, has identified the name of Michel Barnier's UK counterpart David Frost. So filtering articles for "Barnier", "Frost" and "UK-EU" should help narrow the focus.

```{r}
#| label: focus

context_df <- 
  trade_df |> 
  filter(str_detect(body, "barnier|frost|uk-eu")) 

context_corp <- 
  context_df |> 
  corpus(docid_field = "short_url", text_field = "body")
```

Quanteda's[@quanteda] `kwic` function shows key phrases in context to ensure we're homing in on the required texts. Short URLs are included below so one can click on any to read the actual article as presented by The Guardian.

```{r}
#| label: kwic

set.seed(123)

context_corp |>
  tokens(
    remove_punct = TRUE,
    remove_symbols = TRUE,
    remove_numbers = TRUE
  ) |>
  kwic(pattern = phrase(c("trade negotiation", "trade deal", "trade talks")), 
       valuetype = "regex", window = 7) |>
  as_tibble() |>
  left_join(article_df, by = join_by(docname == short_url)) |> 
  slice_sample(n = 10) |> 
  select(docname, pre, keyword, post, headline)
```

Quanteda provides a sentiment dictionary which, in addition to identifying positive and negative words, also finds negative-negatives and negative-positives such as, for example, "not effective". For each week's worth of articles, we can calculate the proportion of positive sentiments.

```{r}
#| label: sentiment

tic()

sent_df <- 
  context_corp |> 
  tokens() |> 
  dfm(dictionary = data_dictionary_LSD2015) |> 
  as_tibble() |>
  left_join(context_df, by = join_by(doc_id == short_url)) |> 
  mutate(
    pos = positive + neg_negative,
    neg = negative + neg_positive,
    web_date = date_ceiling(as_date(web_publication_date), "week"),
    pct_pos = pos / (pos + neg)
  )

sent_df |> 
  select(Article = doc_id, "Pos Score" = pos, "Neg Score" = neg) |> 
  slice(1:10)

summary_df <- sent_df |> 
  summarise(pct_pos = mean(pct_pos), 
            n = n(),
            .by = web_date)

toc()
```

Plotting the changing proportion of positive sentiment over time did surprise me a little. The outcome was more balanced than I expected which perhaps confirms the deeper impression left on me by negative articles.

The upper plot shows a rolling 7-day mean with a narrowing ribbon representing a narrowing variation in sentiment.

The lower plot shows the volume of articles. As we drew closer to the crunch-point the volume picked up.

```{r}
#| label: plot

width <- 7

sent_df2 <- sent_df |>
  mutate(web_date = as_date(web_publication_date)) |> 
  group_by(web_date) |>
  summarise(pct_pos = sum(pos) / sum(neg + pos)) |> 
  mutate(
    roll_mean = slide_dbl(pct_pos, mean, .before = 6),
    roll_lq = slide_dbl(pct_pos, ~ quantile(.x, probs = 0.25), .before = 6),
    roll_uq = slide_dbl(pct_pos, ~ quantile(.x, probs = 0.75), .before = 6)
  )

p1 <- sent_df2 |>
  ggplot(aes(web_date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = roll_mean), colour = cols[1]) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = roll_lq, ymax = roll_uq), 
              alpha = 0.33, fill = cols[1]) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, linetype = "dashed", 
             colour = cols[4], linewidth = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_percent(accuracy = 1)) +
  labs(
    title = "Changing Sentiment Towards a UK-EU Trade Deal",
    subtitle = glue("Rolling {width} days Since the Withdrawal Agreement"),
    x = NULL, y = "Positive Sentiment"
  )

p2 <- summary_df |> 
  ggplot(aes(web_date, n)) +
  geom_line(colour = cols[1]) +
  labs(x = "Weeks", y = "Article Count",
       caption = "Source: Guardian Newspaper")

p1 / p2 + 
  plot_layout(heights = c(2, 1))
