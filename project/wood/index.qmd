![](feature.gif){fig-alt="A small clump of trees with a \"Little Wood\" sign nailed to one of them. It's a dark starry night and a rabbit peers out at a thief tip-toeing away."}

In [Criminal Goings-on](/project/forest) faceting offered a way to get a sense of the data. This is a great visualisation tool building on the principle of small multiples. There may come a point though where the sheer volume of small multiples make it harder to "see the wood for the trees". What's an alternative strategy?

```{r}
#| label: libraries

library(conflicted)
library(tidyverse)
conflict_prefer_all("dplyr", quiet = TRUE)
library(trelliscope)
library(janitor)
library(vangogh)
library(usedthese)

conflict_scout()
```

This time I'll use Van Gogh's "The Starry Night" palette for the feature image and plots. And there are 12 types of criminal offence, so `colorRampPalette` will enable the interpolation of an extended set.

```{r}
#| label: theme
#| fig-height: 2
#| dev.args: { bg: "transparent" }

theme_set(theme_bw())

(cols <- vangogh_palette("StarryNight"))

cols12 <- colorRampPalette(cols)(12)
```

The data need a little tidy-up.

```{r}
#| label: read

crime_df <- str_c(
  "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/recorded_crime_summary/",
  "934f2ddb-5804-4c6a-a17c-bdd79b33430e/", 
  "MPS%20Borough%20Level%20Crime%20%28Historical%29.csv"
  ) |> 
  read_csv(show_col_types = FALSE) |> 
  clean_names() |> 
  rename_with(\(x) str_remove_all(x, "_text|look_up_|_name")) |> 
  pivot_longer(where(is.numeric), names_to = "month", values_to = "num_offences") |> 
  mutate(month = parse_number(month) |> str_c("01") |> ymd())
```

The original visualisation in [Criminal Goings-on](/project/forest) using ggplot's `facet_wrap` is a little tricky to digest.

```{r}
#| label: facet
#| fig-height: 12

crime_df |>
  summarise(num_offences = sum(num_offences), .by = c(major, borough, month)) |>
  ggplot(aes(month, num_offences, colour = major, group = major)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~borough, scales = "free_y", ncol = 4) +
  labs(
    x = NULL, y = NULL, title = "London Crime by Borough",
    colour = "Offence", caption = "Source: data.gov.uk"
  ) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = cols12) +
  guides(colour = guide_legend(nrow = 3)) +
  theme(
    strip.background = element_rect(fill = cols[4]),
    legend.position = "bottom",
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)
  )
```

This "little project" was first published using [trelliscopejs](https://hafen.github.io/trelliscopejs/) which offered a really nice alternative approach to the static `facet_wrap`. This has been recently reimagined by the superior and easier-to-use [trelliscope](https://github.com/trelliscope) package. I've updated this post to use the "latest and greatest".
